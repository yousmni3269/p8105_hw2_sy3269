# Problem 1

Read and clean NYC subway data. Then convert the entry variable from
character to a logical variable.

``` r
metro_df = 
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",  na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  mutate(
    entry = case_match(
      entry, 
      "YES" ~ TRUE,
      "NO" ~ FALSE
    ))
```

The NYC metro data set contains line, station name, station location
(latitude and longitude), routes served, entry and vending availability,
entrance type, and ada compliance information. The data set was first
imported and cleaned using a `janitor::clean_names` function. Then only
the required variables were listed out to remove unnecessary information
from the data set. The dimension of the data set is 1868 x 19. The data
set is in human readable form but not yet tidy.

``` r
stn_num = distinct(metro_df, station_name, line, ada)
ada_num = filter(stn_num, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 465 distinct stations and there are 84 ADA compliant stations.

``` r
nv_stn = filter(metro_df, vending == "NO")
nv_entry_stn = filter(nv_stn, entry == TRUE)
```

69 stations out of 183 stations without vending allow entrance. The
proportion is about 2.6521739.

``` r
new_metro_df = 
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    route7 = as.character(route7),
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)
  ) |> 
  select(line, station_name, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  pivot_longer( 
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The data set was reformatted so that `route number` and `route name` are
distinct variables.

``` r
stn_for_A = filter(new_metro_df, route_name == "A") |>
  distinct()

stn_for_A_ada = filter(stn_for_A, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 91 stations that serve the A train and 34 of these stations
are ADA compliant.

# Problem 2

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read_excel use reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer) Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the
data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine this with the
Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track
of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional
variable to both datasets before combining.

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022?
